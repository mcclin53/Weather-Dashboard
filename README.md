  ## Installation
This app is deployed to render so the user can easily view the application.

  ## Usage
The user will type in the name of the city that they are seeking weather information about. This will display a forecast of the weather for that location.  If the user chooses to change locations, simply typing  the name of a new city will refresh the information on the page. If the user chooses, they can delete the city from the search history on the left hand side of the screen.
